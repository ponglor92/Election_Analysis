## Overview of the Election Audit
### Purpose
-	The purpose of this election audit analysis was to help Seth and Tom complete some additional data such as: finding the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total votes and the county with the highest turnout. With the knowledge that was gained through working in module 3, I used the skills of if statements, print function, creating strings, calculating percentage, etc. to find the results. 
## Election- Audit Results
-	There was a total of 369,711 congressional votes
o	To find the total votes, I used this: 
-	county_vote_count = county_votes[county_name]
-	Breakdown of the number of votes and percentage for each county
o	Denver: received 306,055 votes with a total percentage of 82.8%
o	Jefferson: received 38,855 votes with a total percentage of 10.5%
o	Arapahoe: received 24,801 votes with a total percentage of 6.7%
-	To find the percentage for each county, I used :
o	Float as the string and the f string function
-	The county with the largest number of votes was Denver
-	Breakdown of the number of votes and percentage for each county
